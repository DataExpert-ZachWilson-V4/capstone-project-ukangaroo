Very Good Girl was launched in 2021. Very Good Girl was created by Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner and Shyamala Maisondieu. Top notes are Litchi and Red Currant; middle note is Rose; base notes are Vanilla and Vetiver. At the beginning of February 2021, Carolina Herrera presents a new flanker in an attractive bright red stiletto bottle. Red is definitely a trend in 2021 because many houses have decided to offer new creations in red bottles. It is composed by Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner and Shyamala Maisondieu. Very Good Girl is a new olfactory adventure that takes a surprising turn: Where previous fragrances in the family explored the subversive power of jasmine or the tonka bean, this new Eau de Parfum ups the ante, drawing its strength from the potency of the rose, a\u00a0distinctive scent,\u00a0which here treads on entirely new ground. VERY GOOD GIRL arrives after last year's creation, Good Girl Supr\u00eame, and Good Girl L\u00e9g\u00e8re from 2018. They\u00a0stand out\u00a0as different compositions from the other editions of the collection, which were limited edition bottles of the original Good Girl creation from 2016. As the brand explains: \"Rose and vetiver: an idyllic contrast. Very Good Girl is a Floral Fruity fragrance. Its aromatic journey starts with the currant, a playfully mischievous wild berry that\u2019s joined by the exotic lychee in a unity of confidence. It\u2019s at this point that the singular yet mysterious qualities of the rose come into play. As one of the most important raw ingredients in the history of perfumery, it has previously seen countless interpretations. All-encompassing and seductive, its unique scent is an ace up any sleeve, which is exactly what perfumers Quentin Bisch and Louise Turner capitalized on for this new chapter in the Good Girl universe.\" \"Here, it\u2019s the creamy and powdery nuances of the rose that come to the fore, with an indulgent romanticism that\u2019s as warm and silky as the world\u2019s most seductive red lipstick. There\u2019s no need to justify a declaration of love for this most luxurious of ingredients, and even if this were reason enough to create a fragrance, Quentin Bisch and Louise Turner are anything but a conformist. Hence why the final burst in Very Good Girl is a veiled background of vetiver, the raw form of which evokes the smell of wood, and is often used in men\u2019s perfumery. It\u2019s a key ingredient of Bad Boy, for example, but also of Good Girl Supr\u00eame, providing a surprising and contemporary counterpoint that in this new fragrance creates an alliance with the warmth of vanilla. The result is a floral fragrance that enhances the natural beauty of its raw ingredients, but without forgoing creativity.\" As Carolina Herrera famously said, \u201cFashion is evolution, not revolution,\u201d a maxim that fully applies to this new fragrance. Just as when Wes Gordon modernizes timeless materials such as silk or leather when designing fashion for the brand, the rose is used with a completely contemporary aesthetic. This is why Very Good Girl is not only a tour de force for the senses, it\u2019s also a fragrance that\u2019s ready to wear and enjoy in the modern world. The red bottle is not the first in the collection, but it differs in design.\u00a0Good Girl Velvet Fatale was the first red fragrance of the collection made in a bottle of dark red velvet, while the new creation is as shiny and glassy as the original edition. The true fans of the line now have a new object of desire.

This is a new fragrance. Bad Boy Cobalt Parfum Electrique was launched in 2022. The nose behind this fragrance is Domitille Michalon Bertier. Top notes are Lavender and Pink Pepper; middle notes are Plum and Geranium; base notes are Vetiver, Truffle, Cedar and Oak. Following the global success of Bad Boy and Bad Boy Le Parfum, Carolina Herrera puts an electrifying twist on the dual nature of the modern man with Bad Boy Cobalt. This new men\u2019s fragrance cracks open convention while exploring the diverse bonds of brotherhood, embodied in nature by the unapologetic strength found in cobalt and its powerfully pigmented blue. Working closely with Carolina A. Herrera, Creative Director of fragrances at Carolina Herrera, Perfumer Domitille Michalon Bertier delved into the depths of her imagination to develop this technically accomplished perfume. Together, they fused mineral sexiness and wild freshness for an energizing and contrasted new release, which is contained in a fresh cobalt blue conceptualization of the already iconic Bad Boy lightning bolt perfume bottle. Every fragrance has dominant notes that allow its message to be transmitted, giving it its soul and unique signature. For Bad Boy Cobalt, the team chose to work with the incredible contrasts of the new \u201cMagic Spark ELIXIR\u201d, an ingredient that elegantly expresses the complementary contradictions of brotherhood, the nuance, and strength of a friendship between men. Just as cobalt dyes glass that particular shade of blue, this ELIXIR colors the fragrance from top to bottom with lively citrus accents, simultaneously producing intriguingly earthy undertones. The Magic Spark ELIXIR blends pink pepper and geranium to create the fresher part of Bad Boy Cobalt. Pink pepper offers a distinctively fresh tone with aromatic and slightly floral suggestions, while geranium is a floral yet masculine note that was a prominent part of Carolina Herrera for Men, the first masculine fragrance from the house of Herrera, first launched in 1991. The mineral accents of a truffle accord are invigorated with the literal and metaphorical strength of oakwood, and infused with the masculinity of vetiver, together with the sexiness of cedarwood to create the hooking base of the fragrance. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just the symbolism of the lighting bolt that allowed my imagination to run wild,\u201d says Domitille Michalon-Bertier. \u201cCobalt is found in the earth\u2019s crust, and I found myself reflecting on lightning cracking Bad Boy Cobalt the ground open, revealing this chemical element together with the dense smells of the soil.\u201d Oakwood, with its touch of smokiness, is a historical symbol of endurance, \u201cbeautifully representing the enduring strength within a band of brothers\u201d to the creator of Bad Boy Cobalt. Meanwhile, vetiver is a perennial plant, drawing its subtle fragrance from volcanic soil saturated with mineral salts, and is a classic ingredient of men\u2019s perfumery. The essential oils of cedarwood has been extracted since ancient Egyptian times, here supplying a powerful dry and vibrating edge with additional clean and green facets. At Carolina Herrera, vetiver has historically been a reference to exotic travel, to the Caribbean vistas of locations such as Haiti. Today, the House of Herrera creates this new fragrance using a vetiver sourced from Haiti, and is at the root of a program called Sourcing for Shared Value, which finds greener ways to grow and harvest this important ingredient while protecting the people who work the land by supporting with local education and infrastructure. It\u2019s a lengthy process to make sure that the vetiver used is the most beautiful, ethical, and greenest product for both the population and for the planet. In their distinctive ways, each fragrance in the Bad Boy family plays on the dual nature of the contemporary man, a concept that is reinforced and developed with Bad Boy Cobalt and its exploration of the bonds of brotherhood. Modern men are aware that there\u2019s no strength without sensitivity, or power without compassion, so the short circuit of freshness in the top notes and the deep base notes of Bad Boy Cobalt are enhanced by a floral heart to the perfume. Composed of clean aromatic lavender and juicy black plum, it evokes the emotional tenderness that\u2019s at the center of the most durable of male friendships. The powerful contrasting nature of this masculine duality is enigmatically represented by the bottle, with its blue to transparent gradient. An exquisite reimagining of the emblematic lightning bolt from the Bad Boy universe, it shows us Bad Boy at his most elegant, inspired to be himself, and confident that anything is possible alongside his trusted and beloved friends.", "top notes": ["Lavender", "Pink Pepper"], "middle notes": ["Plum", "Geranium"], "base notes": ["Vetiver", "Truffle", "Cedar", "Oak"], "longevity": {"very weak": 33, "weak": 95, "moderate": 978, "long lasting": 504, "eternal": 56}, "sillage": {"intimate": 141, "moderate": 1117, "strong": 304, "enormous": 27}, "gender_vote": {"female": 11, "more female": 10, "unisex": 79, "more male": 559, "male": 1018}, "price value": {"way overpriced": 54, "overpriced": 258, "ok": 864, "good value": 331, "great value": 47}}, {"name": "The Noir 29", "company": "Le Labo", "image": "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.31872.jpg", "for_gender": "for women and men", "rating": 4.2, "number_votes": 3824, "main accords": {"woody": 100.0, "fresh spicy": 82.4569, "sweet": 73.5631, "aromatic": 72.1136, "fruity": 67.6205, "tobacco": 65.8006, "green": 61.9426, "citrus": 51.0438, "powdery": 47.6818, "musky": 46.941}, "description": "The Noir 29 by Le Labo is a Aromatic fragrance for women and men.
