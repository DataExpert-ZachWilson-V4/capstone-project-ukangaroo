# Fragrance Recommendation Project

## Overview
The project outlined in this proposal is to serve as the capstone project for the DataExpert.io V4 bootcamp. For the project I will build a system what will recommend top 5 fragrances based on user's preference. 

## Target Audience
The target audience for this project are anyone who does not like to go into a fragrance store, especially men or anyone who usually does a blind purchase of fragrances. With this data pipeline, I hope the recommended fragrance would reduce the probability of failed blind buys which will help them save money and time.

## Desired Insights
This recommendation feature can not only help others reduce the time and research on finding a new fragrance they like, but also provide more variety of options based on availability, prices and quality.

### Initial Implementation
The initial implementation of the project seeks to answer the following questions:
1. What are the Top 5 fragrances similar to the fragrance/s of their choice?
	- Compared with their
		- top notes/middle notes/base notes
		- price
    - availability
2. How do the above measures vary by country, industry, and market capitalization?

The results for the first iteration of the project will be displayed in a Tableau dashboard.
